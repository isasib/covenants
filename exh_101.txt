               meaning in that Finance Document or notice as in this Agreement.

               the plural and vice versa.

       (g)     The Arranger is a party to this Agreement solely to receive the benefit of various
               acknowledgements. Future amendments, consents or waivers under this Agreement
               will not require the Arranger (in that capacity) to execute any document or do any
               other action unless such amendments, consents or waivers affect the Arranger in its
               capacity as such.

1.3    Currency symbols and definitions
       "A$", "AUD" and "Australian dollars" denote the lawful currency of Australia and "NZ$"

1.5    Changes in Australian Accounting Standards
       (a)    If solely as a result of compliance with the International Financial Reporting
              Standards (“IFRS”) or a change in Accounting Standards, the Borrowers do not
              comply with the financial covenants set out in Clause 21 (Financial covenants), or if
              those financial covenants are no longer appropriate, the Company and the Agent will
              negotiate in good faith to make amendments to those financial covenants which take
              into account the changes to the accounts of the Group resulting from IFRS or the

                change. Prior to reaching agreement, the financial covenants will be tested on the
                same basis as tested prior to the introduction of IFRS or the change in Accounting
                Standards.

       (b)      The parties agree that all covenants in this Agreement have been drafted with the
                intention that the Group Members comply with those covenants based on
                International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17 (as at the date of this Agreement).
                Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Company and the Agent, any
                subsequent revision, amendment, restatement or replacement of IAS 17 which
                changes, or eliminates, the distinction between operating leases and finance leases
                does not apply to this Agreement.

1.6    Limitation on liability of trustee Lenders
       Any limitation of liability conforming to the requirements of Schedule 4 (Form of Transfer

       Lender which is a trustee of a fund will apply in respect of that Lender as if incorporated in this
       Agreement.

1.7    Obligors’ agent
       (a)     All communications and notices under the Finance Documents to and from the

       (b)      Each Obligor (other than the Company) irrevocably appoints the Company to act on
                its behalf as its agent in connection with the Finance Documents and irrevocably

                (ii)   give and receive all communications and notices (including any Utilisation
                       Request) and instructions under the Finance Documents; and

                (iii) agree and sign all documents under or in connection with the Finance
                      Documents (including any amendment, novation, supplement, extension or
                      restatement of or to any Finance Document) without further reference to, or the
                      consent of, that Obligor.

       (c)      An Obligor shall be bound by any act of the Company under this Clause 1.7
                (Obligors' agent) irrespective of whether the Obligor knew about it or whether it
                occurred before the Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance Document.

       (d)      To the extent that there is any conflict between any communication or notice by the
                Company on behalf of an Obligor and any other Obligor, those of the Company shall
                prevail.

2.     THE FACILITIES
2.1    The Facilities
       Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Lenders make available to the Borrowers:

       (a)     a single draw amortising term loan facility in an aggregate amount equal to the Total
               Facility A Commitments; and

       (b)     a single draw bullet loan facility in an aggregate amount equal to the Total Facility B1
               Commitments;

       (c)     a single draw bullet loan facility in an aggregate amount equal to the Total Facility B2
               Commitments; and

       (d)     a revolving working capital facility in an aggregate amount equal to the Total Facility
               C Commitments.

2.2    Finance Parties' rights and obligations
       (a)     The obligations of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several.
               Failure by a Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents
               does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Finance Documents. No
               Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Finance Party under the
               Finance Documents.

       (b)     The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents
               are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance
               Documents to a Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt in
               respect of which a Finance Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance
               with paragraph (c) below. The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing to
               that Finance Party under the Finance Documents and for the avoidance of doubt, any
               part of a Loan or any other amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance
               Party's participation in a Facility or its role under a Finance Document (including any
               such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) is a debt owing to that Finance Party
               by that Obligor.

       (c)     A Finance Party may, except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents,
               separately enforce its rights under or in connection with the Finance Documents.

3.     PURPOSE
3.1    Purpose
       (a)     Each Borrower shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under Facility A, Facility B1
               and Facility B2 towards refinancing existing Financial Indebtedness of the Obligors
               and to pay related fees and other expenses in connection with the refinancing.

                financing working capital, Capital Expenditure and general corporate purposes of the
                Group.

       pursuant to this Agreement.

4.     CONDITIONS OF UTILISATION
4.1    Initial conditions precedent

       notify the Company and the Lenders promptly upon being so satisfied.

         (c)   The Total Facility A Commitments shall reduce on each Facility A Repayment Date
               by the amount of the relevant Facility A Repayment Instalment. When the Total

                           Loan; and

               (ii)    the proportion borne by each Lender's participation in the maturing Facility C
                       Loan to the amount of that maturing Facility C Loan is the same as the

                          (A)   the relevant Borrower will not be required to make a payment under
                                Clause 30.1 (Payments to the Agent); and

                          (B)   each Lender will be required to make a payment under Clause 30.1
                                (Payments to the Agent) in respect of its participation in the new
                                Facility C Loans only to the extent that its participation in the new
                                Facility C Loans exceeds that Lender's participation in the maturing
                                Facility C Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in
                                the new Facility C Loans shall be treated as having been made
                                available and applied by the relevant Borrower in or towards
                                repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing Facility C
                                Loan.

       (c)     Unless a contrary indication appears in this Agreement, a Borrower may reborrow any
               part of Facility C which is repaid.

6.4    Term out of Defaulting Finance Party's Facility C Loans
       (a)    When a Lender becomes a Defaulting Finance Party, the participation of the Lender
              in the Facility C Loans then outstanding denominated in any currency will be treated
              as a separate Facility C Loan denominated in that currency and the maturity date of
              that Loan will be automatically extended to the Maturity Date.

       (b)     A Borrower may prepay any such Loan if it gives at least 5 Business Days' prior
               notice to the Agent, who shall promptly notify the relevant Defaulting Finance Party.

       (c)     Interest in respect of any such Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods
               selected by the Borrower for that Loan by the time and date specified by the Agent
               (acting reasonably) and will be payable on the last day of each such Interest Period.

7.     PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION
7.1    Illegality
       If, in any applicable jurisdiction, it becomes unlawful (or impossible as a result of a change in
       law or regulation) for any Lender (or an Affiliate of that Lender) to perform any of its
       obligations as contemplated by this Agreement or to fund or maintain its participation in any
       Loan:

       (a)      that Lender shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event;

       (b)      upon the Agent notifying the Company, each Available Commitment of that Lender
                will be immediately cancelled; and

       (c)      to the extent that the Lender's participation has not been transferred pursuant to
                paragraph (d) of Clause 7.5 (Right of replacement or repayment and cancellation in
                relation to a single Lender), each Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in
                the Loans made to that Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period for each Loan
                occurring after the Agent has notified the Company or, if earlier, the date specified by
                the Lender in the notice delivered to the Agent (being no earlier than the last day of
                any applicable grace period permitted by law) and that Lender's corresponding
                Commitment(s) shall be cancelled in the amount of the participations repaid.

7.2    Review Event

       (a)      the Company shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event;

       (b)      a Lender shall not be obliged to fund any further Loan (except for a Rollover Loan)
                while the Review Event is continuing;

       (c)      the Company and the Agent must consult in good faith for 30 days (or such longer
                period as the Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) may agree)
                (the “Standstill Period”) in relation to the Review Event and seek to reach agreement
                on how to remedy or overcome the effects of the consequences of the Review Event,
                including (but not limited to) a restructure of the terms of the Facilities to the
                satisfaction of the Majority Lenders; and

       (d)      if upon the expiry of the Standstill Period the Company and the Agent have not
                reached agreement on how to remedy or overcome the effects of the consequences of
                the Review Event, if the Majority Lenders so require, the Agent shall, by not less than
                60 days’ notice to the Company, cancel the Total Commitments and declare all
                outstanding Loans, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued
                under the Finance Documents immediately due and payable, whereupon the Total
                Commitments will be cancelled and all such outstanding Loans and amounts will
                become immediately due and payable.

7.3    Voluntary cancellation
       The Company may, if it gives the Agent not less than 5 Business Days' (or such shorter period
       as the Agent and Majority Lenders may agree) prior notice, cancel the whole or any part (being




32801928_16                                     - 45 -
       a minimum amount of A$1,000,000) of an Available Facility. Any cancellation under this
       Clause 7.3 shall reduce the Commitments of the Lenders rateably under that Facility.

7.4    Voluntary prepayment
       (a)    A Borrower to which a Loan has been made may, if it gives the Agent not less than 5
              Business Days' (or such shorter period as the Agent and Majority Lenders may agree)
              prior notice, prepay the whole or any part of any Loan (but, if in part, being an
              amount that reduces the Base Currency Amount of the Loan by a minimum amount of
              A$1,000,000).

       (b)     Any prepayment of a Facility A Loan made under this Clause 7.4 shall be applied to
               reduce the remaining Facility A Repayment Instalments on a pro rata basis.

7.5    Right of replacement or repayment and cancellation in relation to a single Lender
       (a)     If:

               (i)    any sum payable to any Lender by an Obligor is required to be increased under
                      Clause 13.2(c) (Tax gross-up); or

               (ii)   any Lender claims any sum from the Company under Clause 13.3 (Tax
                      indemnity) or Clause 14.1 (Increased costs),

               the Company may, whilst the circumstance giving rise to the requirement for that
               increase or claim continues, give the Agent notice of cancellation of the Commitment
               of that Lender and its intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's participation
               in the Loans or give the Agent notice of its intention to replace that Lender in
               accordance with paragraph (d) below.

       (b)     On receipt of a notice of cancellation referred to in paragraph (a) above in relation to
               a Lender, the Commitment of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.

       (c)     On the last day of each Interest Period which ends after the Company has given notice
               of cancellation under paragraph (a) above (or, if earlier, the date specified by the
               Company in that notice), each Borrower to which a Loan is outstanding shall repay
               that Lender's participation in that Loan.

       (d)     If:

               (i)    any of the circumstances set out in paragraph (a) above apply to a Lender; or

               (ii)   an Obligor becomes obliged to pay any amount in accordance with Clause 7.1
                      (Illegality) to any Lender,

               the Company may, on 10 Business Days' prior notice to the Agent and that Lender,
               replace that Lender by requiring that Lender to (and, to the extent permitted by law,
               that Lender shall) transfer pursuant to Clause 24 (Changes to the Lenders) all (and not
               part only) of its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents (including in
               relation to any hedging between that Lender (or its Affiliate, if applicable) and an
               Obligor) to a Lender or another bank, or financial institution, or to a trust, fund or
               other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making,

               derivatives) in any such case selected by the Company which confirms its willingness
               to assume and does assume all the obligations of the transferring Lender (and
               Affiliate) in accordance with Clause 24 (Changes to the Lenders) (or, in the case of
               any hedging, in accordance with such documents as the transferring Lender,
               Replacement Lender and Company may agree (each acting reasonably)) for a
               purchase price in cash payable at the time of the transfer in an amount equal to the
               outstanding principal amount of such Lender's participation in the outstanding Loans
               and all accrued interest, Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto
               under the Finance Documents (and in respect of any hedging as certified by the
               transferring Lender and as calculated in accordance with the relevant Hedging
               Agreement).

       (e)     The replacement of a Lender pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall be subject to the
               following conditions:

                     pay or surrender any of the fees received by such Lender pursuant to the
                     Finance Documents; and

               (iv) the Lender shall only be obliged to transfer its rights and obligations pursuant to
                    paragraph (d) above once it is satisfied that it has complied with all necessary
                    "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and
                    regulations in relation to that transfer.

       (f)     A Lender shall perform the checks described in paragraph (e)(iv) above as soon as
               reasonably practicable following delivery of a notice referred to in paragraph (d)
               above and shall notify the Agent and the Company when it is satisfied that it has
               complied with those checks.

7.6    Right of cancellation in relation to a Defaulting Finance Party
       (a)     The Company may give the Agent 10 Business Days' notice of cancellation of each

                prepaid and is not available for redrawing (other than by operation of Clause 4.2
                (Further conditions precedent)), an amount of the Lender's Commitment (equal to the

                       receipt applied or committed to be applied in rectifying the problem the subject
                       of the claim, replacing assets or meeting liabilities (including payment of Tax)

         (b)   Excess Cashflow will be calculated on the basis of the annual audited financial
               statements of the Group delivered under Clause 20.1(a) (Financial statements).
               Prepayment must be made within 30 days after delivery of such reports.

8.3    Application of Mandatory Prepayments
        (a)     Amounts mandatorily prepaid under Clause 8 (Mandatory Prepayment) must be
                applied:

               (i)    first, to repay Facility A Loans, by application pro-rata against all future Facility
                      A Repayment Instalments;

               (ii)   secondly, if Facility A has been fully repaid rateably, in reduction of Facility B1
                      Loans or Facility B2 Loans; and

               (iii) then, if Facility A, Facility B1 and Facility B2 have been fully repaid, in
                     reduction of Facility C Loans. A repayment against a Facility C Loans cancels
                     the respective portion of Facility C that has been prepaid and cannot be
                     redrawn.

         (b)   All mandatory prepayments (except under Clause 8.1 (Mandatory Prepayment
               Events)) will, subject to paragraph (c) below, be made on the last day of the Interest
               Period relating to the Loan to be prepaid (so as not to break an Interest Period).
               Pending such prepayment, amounts required to be prepaid must be paid to and held
               in an Interest Prepayment Account. Any money so held in an Interest Prepayment
               Account which is required to be prepaid must be applied in prepayment on the last
               day of the Interest Period relating to the Loan to be prepaid. If an Event of Default
               subsists, the Security Trustee may direct the Company as to the application of any
               money held in any Interest Prepayment Account (or exercise its rights under the
               Account Bank Deed).

         (c)   A Borrower may request the Agent to immediately apply any mandatory prepayment
               towards prepayment of the Loans (and not pay and hold such amount in the Interest
               Prepayment Account until the last day of the relevant Interest Period). If a Borrower
               does so:

               (i)    paragraph (b) above will not apply; and

               (ii)   without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Clauses 7.7(b) and 11.6
                      will apply.

               Each Lender authorises the Agent to comply with a request made by a Borrower
               under and in accordance with this paragraph (c).

9.     INTEREST
9.1    Interest
       The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the Interest Rate.

9.2    Payment of interest
       The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the
       last day of each Interest Period.

9.3    Notification of rates of interest
       (a)      The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Lenders and the relevant Borrower of
                the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.

       (b)      The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower of each Funding Rate relating
                to a Loan.

10.    INTEREST PERIODS
10.1   Selection of Interest Periods
       (a)      Each Interest Period for a Loan will be three Months.

       (b)      An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Maturity Date.

       (c)      Each Interest Period for a Facility A Loan, a Facility B1 Loan or a Facility B2 Loan
                shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding
                Interest Period.

       (d)      A Facility C Loan has one Interest Period only and shall start on the Utilisation Date.

10.2   Non-Business Days
       If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest
       Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the
       preceding Business Day (if there is not).

11.    CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST
11.1   Unavailability of Screen Rate
       (a)     Interpolated Screen Rate: If no Screen Rate is available for BBSY Bid or BKBM, as
               applicable, for the Interest Period of a Loan, the applicable BBSY Bid or BKBM shall
               be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of
               that Loan, except where the Interest Period is less than the shortest period published
               for BBSY Bid or BKBM, as applicable, in which case it will be BBSY Bid or BKBM
               for the shortest period published for BBSY Bid or BKBM.

       (b)      Reference Bank Rate: If no Screen Rate is available for BBSY Bid or BKBM, as
                applicable, for the Interest Period of a Loan and it is not possible to calculate the
                Interpolated Screen Rate or other rate under paragraph (a) above, the applicable
                BBSY Bid or BKBM shall be the Reference Bank Rate at or about 11.00a.m. (in the




32801928_16                                      - 52 -
                relevant place) on the Quotation Day for the currency of that Loan and for a period
                equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.

       (c)      Cost of Funds: If paragraph (b) above applies but no Reference Bank Rate is available
                for the relevant currency and Interest Period, there shall be no BBSY Bid or BKBM,
                as applicable, for that Loan and Clause 11.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan
                for that Interest Period.

11.2   Calculation of Reference Bank Rate
       (a)     Subject to paragraph (b) below, if BBSY Bid or BKBM, as applicable, is to be
               determined on the basis of a Reference Bank Rate but a Reference Bank does not
               supply a quotation by 12.00 noon (in the relevant place) on the Quotation Day, the
               Reference Bank Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the
               remaining Reference Banks.

       (b)      If at or about 12.00 noon (in the relevant place) on the Quotation Day none or only
                one of the Reference Banks supplies a quotation, there shall be no Reference Bank
                Rate for that Interest Period.

11.3   Market disruption
       If before 5.00p.m. (Sydney time) on the second Business Day after the Quotation Day for the
       relevant Interest Period, the Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose
       participations in a Loan exceed 30 per cent. of that Loan) that as a result of market
       circumstances not limited to it (whether or not those circumstances, or their effect on the
       Lender’s cost of funds, subsist on the date it becomes a Lender), the cost to it of funding its
       participation in that Loan (from whatever source it may reasonably select) would be in excess
       of BBSY Bid or BKBM, as applicable (in which case an "Affected Lender" will be a Lender
       which gives such a notification), then Clause 11.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to the
       participation in the Loan of each Affected Lender for the relevant Interest Period.

11.4   Cost of funds
       (a)      If this Clause 11.4 applies, the rate of interest on each relevant Lender's share of the
                relevant Loan for the relevant Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum
                which is the sum of:

                (i)    the Margin; and

                (ii)

                       (A) in the circumstances described in Clause 11.3 (Market disruption), the rate
                           notified to the Agent by the relevant Affected Lender; and

                       (B) in the circumstances described in Clause 11.1 (Unavailability of Screen
                           Rate), the weighted average of the rates notified to the Agent by each
                           relevant Lender,

                       to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum, the cost to the
                       Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may




32801928_16                                     - 53 -
                     reasonably select. That rate is to be notified as soon as practicable and in any
                     event before interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period; and

               (iii) the rate applicable under paragraph (c) of the definition of Interest Rate at that
                     time (if any).

       (b)     If this Clause 11.4 applies and the Agent (acting on the instructions of all Lenders) or
               the Company so requires, the Agent and the Company shall enter into negotiations
               (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for
               determining the rate of interest.

       (c)     Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall, with the prior
               consent of all the Lenders and the Company, be binding on all Parties.

       (d)     If this Clause 11.4 applies, but any Lender does not supply a quotation by the time
               specified in paragraph (a)(ii)(B) above, the rate of interest for that Lender shall be
               calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Lenders.

11.5   Agent's role and confidentiality
       (a)     The Agent shall promptly notify the Company if there is a market disruption event
               under Clause 11.3 (Market disruption) and of the identity of any Lender or Lenders
               giving a notice under that Clause.

       (b)     A Lender who gives a notification under Clause 11.3 (Market disruption) at any time
               before 5.00p.m. (Sydney time) on the Business Day after the relevant Quotation Day
               may in that notification request the Agent to notify each other Lender that it has
               received a notification under Clause 11.3 (Market disruption) (without giving details)
               and the Agent shall promptly comply with the request.

11.6   Break Costs
       (a)    Each Borrower shall, within three Business Days of demand by a Finance Party, pay
              to that Finance Party its Break Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan being
              paid by that Borrower on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that
              Loan.

       (b)     Each Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after a demand by the Agent,
               provide a certificate confirming the amount of its Break Costs for any Interest Period
               in which they accrue.

11.7   Margin Adjustments by reference to the Net Leverage Ratio
       (a)    The Net Leverage Ratio will be tested pursuant to Clause 21 (Financial Covenants).

       (b)     Subject to paragraph (c) below, any Margin adjustment will take effect on the first
               day of the Interest Period commencing after receipt by the Agent of the relevant
               Compliance Certificate.

       (c)     No Margin reduction shall take effect before the date the first Compliance Certificate
               is delivered.




32801928_16                                    - 54 -
       (d)     If there is a reduction in the Margin on the basis of quarterly financial statements and,
               when delivered, the annual audited consolidated financial statements of the Group do
               not justify that reduction, the reduction in Margin will be reversed with retrospective
               effect and any additional payment due from the Company in respect of Interest
               Periods which have expired will be due and payable within 10 Business Days of the
               date of the adjustment.

       (e)     If a Compliance Certificate is not delivered on or prior to the required date under
               Clause 20.2 (Provision and contents of Compliance Certificate), then the Margin shall
               be 5.5% per annum until such time as a Compliance Certificate evidencing the Net
               Leverage Ratio is delivered.

12.    FEES
12.1   Commitment fee
       (a)   The Company shall pay to the Agent (for the account of each Lender) a fee in the
             Base Currency computed at the rate of one (1) per cent. per annum on that Lender's
             Available Commitment under Facility C for the Availability Period for Facility C.

       (b)     The accrued commitment fee is payable on the last day of each successive period of

               financier (including with any Lender);

                           ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

13.    TAX GROSS UP AND INDEMNITIES
13.1   Definitions
       (a)      In this Clause 13:

                "Protected Party" means a Finance Party which is or will be subject to any liability,
                or required to make any payment, for or on account of Tax in relation to a sum
                received or receivable (or any sum deemed for the purposes of Tax to be received or
                receivable) under a Finance Document.

                "Tax Credit" means a credit against, relief or remission for, or repayment of any Tax.

                "Tax Payment" means either the increase in a payment made by an Obligor to a
                Finance Party under Clause 13.2 (Tax gross-up) or a payment under Clause 13.3 (Tax
                indemnity).

13.2   Tax Gross-up
       (a)    Each Obligor shall make all payments to be made by it under the Finance Documents
              without any Tax Deduction unless such Tax Deduction is required by law.

       (b)      The Company or a Finance Party shall promptly upon becoming aware that an
                Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the
                basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Agent accordingly. If the Agent receives such
                notification from a Lender it shall notify the Company and that Obligor.

       (c)      If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, except in relation to
                a Tax described in Clause 13.3(b)(i), the Obligor shall pay an additional amount
                together with the payment so that, after making any Tax Deduction, the Finance Party
                receives an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax
                Deduction had been required.

       (d)      If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor shall make that Tax
                Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within
                the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.

       (e)      Within thirty days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in
                connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall
                deliver to the Agent for the Finance Party entitled to the payment evidence
                satisfactory to that Finance Party, acting reasonably, that the Tax Deduction has been
                made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.

13.3   Tax indemnity
       (a)     The Company shall (within three Business Days of demand by the Agent) pay to a
               Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected
               Party determines will be or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account
               of Tax by that Protected Party in respect of a Finance Document or a transaction or
               payment under it.

       (b)     Paragraph (a) shall not apply:

               (i)    with respect to any Tax assessed on a Finance Party if that Tax is imposed on or
                      calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any
                      sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Finance Party:

                      (A) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party is
                          incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that
                          Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

                      (B) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party's Facility

                          jurisdiction; or

               (ii)   to the extent the relevant loss, liability or cost:

                          Gross-up); or

               13.3, notify the Agent.

13.4   Tax Credit
       If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party determines in its absolute
       discretion that:

       (a)     a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence
               of which that Tax Payment was required; and

       (b)     that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,

       subject to Clause 28 (Conduct of Business by the Finance Parties), the Finance Party shall pay
       an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines in its absolute discretion will
       leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the
       circumstances not arisen which caused the Tax Payment to be required to be made by the
       Obligor.

       except Transfer Certificates.

13.6   Indirect Tax
       (a)      All payments to be made by an Obligor under or in connection with any Finance
                Document have been calculated without regard to Indirect Tax. If all or part of any
                such payment is the consideration for a taxable supply or chargeable with Indirect Tax
                then, when the Obligor makes the payment:

               (i)    it must pay to the Finance Party an additional amount equal to that payment (or
                      part) multiplied by the appropriate rate of Indirect Tax; and

               (ii)   the Finance Party will promptly provide to the Obligor a tax invoice complying
                      with the relevant law relating to that Indirect Tax.

       (b)     Where a Finance Document requires an Obligor to reimburse or indemnify a Finance
               Party for any costs or expenses, that Obligor shall also at the same time pay and
               indemnify that Finance Party against all Indirect Tax incurred by that Finance Party in
               respect of the costs or expenses save to the extent that that Finance Party is entitled to
               repayment or credit in respect of the Indirect Tax. The Finance Party will promptly
               provide to the Obligor a tax invoice complying with the relevant law relating to that
               Indirect Tax. Unless notified by that Finance Party, the Obligor must assume that the
               Finance Party is not entitled to any input tax credit for that Indirect Tax.

               (ii)   supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
                      relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for
                      the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA;

               (iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
                     relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of
                     that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of
                     information regime.

       (b)     If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a
               FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased
               to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably
               promptly.

               (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in
               its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

               (ii)   any fiduciary duty; or

               (iii) any duty of confidentiality.

       (d)     If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply
               forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph
               (a)(i) or (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above
               applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents
               (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as
               the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or
               other information.

13.8   FATCA Deduction
       (a)   Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and
             any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall
             be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA
             Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA
             Deduction.

       (b)     Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA
               Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA
               Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall
               notify the Company and the Agent and the Agent shall notify the other Finance
               Parties.

                                               GUARANTEE

18.    GUARANTEE
18.1   Guarantee
       Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

       (a)      guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by each Obligor of all that
                Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

       (b)      undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever an Obligor does not pay any
                amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document (or anything
                which would have been due if the Finance Document or the amount was enforceable,
                valid and not illegal), that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as
                if it was the principal obligor; and

       (c)      agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes
                unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation,
                indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, expense, loss
                or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but
                for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any
                Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount of the cost,
                expense, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that Finance Party would
                otherwise have been entitled to recover.

       Each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) is a separate obligation. None is limited by reference to the
       other.

18.2   Continuing guarantee
       This Guarantee is a continuing obligation and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums
       payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment
       or discharge in whole or in part.

18.3   Reinstatement
       If any payment to or any discharge, release or arrangement given or entered into by a Finance
       Party (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations
       or otherwise) is avoided or reduced for any reason (including as a result of insolvency, breach
       of fiduciary or statutory duties or any similar event) in whole or in part, then the liability of
       each Guarantor under this Clause 18 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release
       or arrangement had not occurred and any relevant security shall be reinstated.

18.4   Waiver of defences
       The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 18 will not be affected by an act,
       omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of
       its obligations under this Clause 18 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any
       Finance Party) including:




32801928_16                                     - 66 -
       (a)      any time, waiver or other concession or consent granted to, or composition with, any
                Obligor or other person;

       (b)      the release or resignation of any other Obligor or any other person;

       (c)      any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any Obligor or other person;

       (d)      the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or
                neglect to perfect, execute, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over
                assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of
                any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to
                realise the full value of any security;

       (e)      any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or
                change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

       (f)      any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental
                and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of any Finance Document or any
                other document or security including any change in the purpose of, any extension of
                or any increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance
                Document or other document or security;

       (g)      any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any
                Finance Document or any other document or security;

       (h)      any set off, combination of accounts or counterclaim;

       (i)      any insolvency or similar proceedings; or

       (j)      this Agreement or any other Finance Document not being executed by or binding
                against any other Obligor or any other party.

       References in Clause 18.1 to obligations of an Obligor or amounts due will include what would
       have been obligations or amounts due but for any of the above, as well as obligations and
       amounts due which result from any of the above.

18.5   Immediate recourse
       Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any
       trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim
       payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 18. This
       waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

18.6   Appropriations
       Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection
       with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any
       trustee or agent on its behalf) may:

       (a)      refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or
                received or recovered (by set off or otherwise) by that Finance Party (or any trustee or
                agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such



32801928_16                                      - 67 -
                manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no
                Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

       (b)      without limiting paragraph (a), refrain from applying any moneys received or
                recovered (by set off or otherwise) from any Guarantor or on account of any
                Guarantor's liability under this Clause 18 in discharge of that liability and claim or
                prove against anyone in respect of the full amount owing by the Obligors.

18.7   Deferral of Guarantors' rights
       Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection
       with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise
       directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it
       of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or
       liability arising, under this Clause 18:

       (a)      to be indemnified by an Obligor;

       (b)      to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of or provider of security for any
                Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

       (c)      to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or
                otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any
                other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance
                Documents by any Finance Party;

       (d)      to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any
                payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a
                Guarantee under Clause 18.1 (Guarantee);

       (e)      to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor;

       (f)      to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party;
                and/or

       (g)      in any form of administration of an Obligor (including liquidation, winding up,
                bankruptcy, voluntary administration, dissolution or receivership or any analogous
                process) prove for or claim, or exercise any vote or other rights in respect of, any
                indebtedness of any nature owed to it by the Obligor.

       If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall
       hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which
       may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with
       the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly
       pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance
       with Clause 30 (Payment mechanics).

18.8   Release of Guarantors' right of contribution
       If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the
       terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring
       Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

       (a)      that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability
                (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a
                contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other
                Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

       (b)      each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of
                its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part
                and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties
                under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in
                connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by
                or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

18.9   Additional security
       This Guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or
       security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.

18.10 Approval
      Each Obligor which holds issued shares, units or partnership interests in a Guarantor, in its
      capacity as holder of those shares, units or partnership interests, confirms that it approves the
      terms of, and the transactions contemplated by, the Finance Documents to which each
      Guarantor is a party (including the terms of this Guarantee).

24.    CHANGES TO THE LENDERS
24.1   Assignments and novations by the Lenders
       Subject to this Clause 24, a Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

       (a)      assign any of its rights; or

       (b)      novate any of its rights and obligations,

       under the Finance Documents to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other
       entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or
       investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (including credit derivatives) (the "New
       Lender").

24.2   Conditions of assignment or novation
       (a)     Unless an Event of Default is continuing, the Lender will consult with the Company
               prior to any such assignment or transfer but, for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of
               the Company is not required for an assignment or transfer by a Lender.

       (b)      An assignment will only be effective:

                (i)    on receipt by the Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of
                       written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory
                       to the Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other
                       Finance Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender;

                (ii)   on performance by the Agent of all its necessary "know your customer" or other
                       similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such
                       assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall promptly
                       notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender; and

                (iii) on receipt by the Agent of confirmation from the Security Trustee that the
                      Security Trustee has performed all its necessary "know your customer" or other
                      similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such
                      assignment to a New Lender (the receipt of which the Agent shall promptly
                      notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender) and the New Lender has
                      become bound by a relevant Beneficiary Accession Deed (as defined in the
                      Security Trust Deed).

       (c)      A novation will only be effective:

                (i)    if the procedure set out in Clause 24.5 (Procedure for novation) is complied
                       with;

                (ii)   on performance by the Agent of all its necessary "know your customer" or other
                       similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such




32801928_16                                      - 92 -
                     novation to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall promptly
                     notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender; and

              (iii) on receipt by the Agent of confirmation from the Security Trustee that the
                    Security Trustee has performed all its necessary "know your customer" or other
                    similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such
                    novation to a New Lender (the receipt of which the Agent shall promptly notify
                    to the Existing Lender and the New Lender) and the New Lender has become
                    bound by a relevant Beneficiary Accession Deed (as defined in the Security
                    Trust Deed).

       (d)    If:

              (i)    a Lender assigns or novates any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
                     Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

              (ii)   as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, novation or
                     change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New
                     Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under Clause 13 (Tax
                     gross-up and indemnities) or Clause 14 (Increased Costs),

              then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled
              to receive payment under those Clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender or
              Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment,
              novation or change had not occurred.

       (e)    Clause 24.2(d) shall not apply where the payment is in relation to Australian
              Withholding Tax and the New Lender, or Lender acting through its new Facility
              Office, is not an Offshore Associate of a Borrower (provided that at no time shall the
              Obligors be liable to make payments for Australian Withholding Tax in respect of
              Commitments in excess of A$50,000,000 (or its equivalent in another currency or
              currencies) held by New Lenders or a Lender acting through its new Facility Office
              where the liability to make such payment would not exist other than pursuant to this
              paragraph (e)). In such instances, the New Lender, or Lender acting through its new
              Facility Office will be entitled to full payment under Clause 13 (Tax gross-up and
              indemnities).

       (f)    Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment
              Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority to
              execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on
              behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or
              prior to the date on which the novation or assignment becomes effective in
              accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same
              extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

       (g)    A Lender may not assign or novate any of its rights or obligations under the Finance
              Documents or change its Facility Office, if the New Lender or the Lender acting
              through its new Facility Office would be entitled to exercise any rights under Clause




32801928_16                                   - 93 -
               7.1 (Illegality) as a result of circumstances existing as at the date the assignment,
               novation or change is proposed to occur.

       (h)     A Lender may enter into funded or unfunded sub-participations or risk participation
               arrangements, collateralised loan obligation, collateralised debt obligation, or any
               similar arrangement without notice to or consent of any other person provided that the
               Lender remains the lender of record.

24.3   Assignment or novation fee
       The New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or novation takes effect, pay to
       the Agent (for its own account) a fee of A$3,000 plus GST.

24.4   Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders
       (a)     Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation
               or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

               (i)    the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Finance
                      Documents or any other documents;

               (ii)   the financial condition of any Obligor or any other person;

               (iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other person of its
                     obligations under the Finance Documents or any other documents; or

               (iv) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in
                    connection with any Finance Document or any other document,

               and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

       (b)     Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that
               it:

               (i)    has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and
                      assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related
                      entities and any other person in connection with its participation in this
                      Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by
                      the Existing Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and

               (ii)   will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of
                      each Obligor and its related entities and any other person whilst any amount is
                      or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in
                      force.

       (c)     Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

               (i)    accept a novation or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and
                      obligations assigned or novated under this Clause 24; or

                (ii)   support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason
                       of the non-performance by any Obligor or any other person of its obligations
                       under the Finance Documents or otherwise.

24.5   Procedure for novation
       (a)    Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 24.2 (Conditions of assignment or
              novation) a novation is effected in accordance with paragraph (e) below when the
              Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the
              Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably
              practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Transfer Certificate appearing on its
              face to comply with the terms of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the
              terms of this Agreement, execute that Transfer Certificate.

       (b)      The Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the
                Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all
                necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and
                regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

       (c)      The Agent may refrain from executing a Transfer Certificate pending satisfaction of
                Clause 24.2(b)(ii) and acting reasonably, may delay executing a Transfer Certificate
                pending a payment, distribution or Utilisation under or in respect of the Finance
                Documents.

       (d)      Each Party other than the Existing Lender irrevocably authorises the Agent to execute

       (e)      On the Transfer Date:

                (i)    to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to novate
                       its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents each of the Obligors and
                       the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one
                       another under the Finance Documents and their respective rights against one
                       another under the Finance Documents shall be cancelled (being the
                       "Discharged Rights and Obligations");

                (ii)   each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one
                       another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
                       Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New
                       Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the
                       Existing Lender;

                (iii) the Agent, the Security Trustee, the Arranger, the New Lender and other
                      Lenders shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between
                      themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been
                      an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it
                      as a result of the novation and to that extent the Agent, the Security Trustee, the
                      Arranger and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations
                      to each other under the Finance Documents;

               (iv) the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and entitled to the benefits
                    of any other document entered into by the Agent as agent for the Lenders and

                    in Clause 24.6(c)(ii) below); and

               (v)    for the purposes of this Agreement, rights and obligations will be taken to have
                      been transferred under a Transfer Certificate even though it operates as a
                      novation and rights and obligations are replaced rather than transferred.

24.6   Procedure for assignment
       (a)    Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 24.2 (Conditions of assignment or
              novation) an assignment may be effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below
              when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Assignment Agreement
              delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Agent shall, subject
              to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly
              completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the terms of
              this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, execute
              that Assignment Agreement.

       (b)     The Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it
               by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with
               all its necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable
               laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.

       (c)     On the Transfer Date:

               (i)    the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender the rights under
                      the Finance Documents expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the
                      Assignment Agreement;

               (ii)   the Existing Lender will be released by each Obligor and the other Finance
                      Parties from the obligations owed by it (the "Relevant Obligations") and
                      expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment Agreement; and

               (iii) the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and entitled to the benefits
                     of any other document entered into by the Agent as agent for the Lenders and
                     will be bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

       (d)     Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this Clause 24.6 to assign
               (including by equitable assignment) their rights under the Finance Documents (but
               not, without the consent of the relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with Clause
               24.5 (Procedure for novation), to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations
               owed to that Obligor by the Lenders nor the assumption of equivalent obligations by a
               New Lender) provided that they comply with the conditions set out in Clause 24.2
               (Conditions of assignment or novation).

       The Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate
       or an Assignment Agreement, send to the Company a copy of that Transfer Certificate or
       Assignment Agreement.

24.8   Security over Lenders' rights
       In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 24, each Lender may
       without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or
       otherwise create Security Interest in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or
       any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including:

       (a)      any charge, assignment or other Security Interest to secure obligations to a federal
                reserve or central bank; and

       (b)      any charge, assignment or other Security Interest granted to any holders (or trustee or
                representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as
                security for those obligations or securities,

       except that no such charge, assignment or Security Interest shall:

                (i)    release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or
                       substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the
                       Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

                (ii)   require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or
                       grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or
                       granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.

               or obligations under the Finance Documents as a Borrower (and without prejudice to

                notification.

25.5   Repetition of Representations
       Delivery of an Accession Letter constitutes confirmation by the relevant Subsidiary that the

                     approval, waiver, amendment, instructions or other decision under the Finance
                     Documents such participation and Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; and

              (ii)   for the purposes of Clause 36.2 (All Lender matters), such Borrower Affiliate or
                     the person with whom it has entered into such sub-participation, other
                     agreement or arrangement shall be deemed not to be a Lender (unless it is a
                     Lender with another Commitment and is not a Borrower Affiliate).

27.    ROLE OF THE AGENT, THE ARRANGER AND THE REFERENCE BANKS
27.1   Appointment of the Agent
       (a)    Each of the Arranger and the Lenders appoints the Agent to act as its agent under and
              in connection with the Finance Documents. The Agent will be agent for the Arranger
              and the Lenders except as described in paragraph (c) below.

       (b)     Each of the Arranger and the Lenders authorises the Agent to perform the duties,
               obligations and responsibilities and to exercise the rights, powers, authorities and
               discretions specifically given to the Agent under or in connection with the Finance
               Documents together with any other incidental rights, powers, authorities and
               discretions.

       (c)     Where the Agent provides services in connection with the administration of the
               Utilisations, that is when it calculates rates and amounts, keeps records, receives and
               distributes payments and information received under Clauses 20.1 (Financial
               statements) and 20.7 (Information: miscellaneous), and receives and deals with
               Utilisation Requests, it does not provide those services as agent for the Arranger or
               the Lenders, but as principal, but the remainder of this Clause 27 still applies.

27.2   Instructions
       (a)      The Agent shall:

               (i)    unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, exercise or refrain
                      from exercising any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it as Agent in
                      accordance with any instructions given to it by:

                      (A) all Lenders if the relevant Finance Document stipulates the matter is an all
                          Lender decision; and

                      (B) in all other cases, the Majority Lenders if the relevant Finance Document
                          stipulates the matter is a Majority Lender decision; and

               (ii)   not be liable for any act (or omission) if it acts (or refrains from acting) in
                      accordance or as permitted by this Clause 27.2.

       (b)     The Agent shall be entitled to request instructions, or clarification of any instruction,
               from the Majority Lenders (or, if the relevant Finance Document stipulates the matter
               is a decision for any other Lender or group of Lenders, from that Lender or group of
               Lenders) as to whether, and in what manner, it should exercise or refrain from
               exercising any right, power, authority or discretion. The Agent may refrain from
               acting unless and until it receives any such instructions or clarification that it has
               requested.

       (c)     If the Agent consults the Majority Lenders (or, if the relevant Finance Document
               stipulates the matter is a decision for any other Lender or group of Lenders, from that
               Lender or group of Lenders) to seek instructions in connection with a matter in

              respect of which the Agent is required under this Agreement to form an opinion, act
              reasonably or in good faith or not to unreasonably withhold or delay consent or
              approval (or any combination of these), each Lender must act in the same manner in
              giving instructions. If the Agent receives such instructions, it may rely on them and it
              has no duty to consider whether a Lender has acted reasonably or in good faith or
              formed the relevant opinion and is deemed to have complied with any reasonableness
              or good faith requirement or formed the relevant opinion (as applicable) in the
              relevant clause and will have no liability for so acting. For the avoidance of doubt, the
              limitation of the Agent’s liability in this paragraph will not affect or limit the
              obligations or liabilities of any Lender to any Obligor in respect of any matter the
              subject of such limitation.

       (d)    Save in the case of decisions stipulated to be a matter for any other Lender or group of
              Lenders under the relevant Finance Document and unless a contrary indication
              appears in a Finance Document, any instructions given to the Agent by the Majority
              Lenders shall override any conflicting instructions given by any other Parties and will
              be binding on all Finance Parties.

       (e)    The Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any Lender
              or group of Lenders until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it
              may in its discretion require (which may be greater in extent than that contained in the
              Finance Documents and which may include payment in advance) for any cost, loss or
              liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions. The Agent may
              specify that the security be cash, in which case the Company must provide it on
              request, failing which each Lender must on request pay its proportion of the cash
              according to its Commitment. Any amount recovered by the Agent under any
              security will be taken to be an amount paid by the party which provided that security.

       (f)    In the absence of instructions, the Agent is not obliged to act, but may act in what it
              (in its sole discretion) considers to be in the best interests of the Lenders.

       (g)    The Agent is not authorised to act on behalf of a Lender (without first obtaining that
              Lender's consent) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to any Finance
              Document.

       (h)    Without limiting any other provision of any Finance Document, the Facility Agent
              may:

              (i)    act or refrain from acting notwithstanding any conflict of interest; and

              (ii)   do anything which in its opinion is necessary for it to comply with any law.

27.3   Duties of the Agent
       (a)     The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical and
               administrative in nature.

       (b)    Subject to paragraph (c) below, the Agent shall promptly forward to a Party the
              original or a copy of any document which is delivered to the Agent for that Party by
              any other Party.



32801928_16                                    - 102 -
       (c)     Without prejudice to Clause 24.7 (Copy of Transfer Certificate or Assignment
               Agreement to Company) paragraph (b) above shall not apply to any Transfer
               Certificate or to any Assignment Agreement.

       (d)     Except where a Finance Document specifically provides otherwise, the Agent is not
               obliged to review or check the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any document
               it forwards to another Party.

       (e)     If the Agent receives notice from a Party referring to this Agreement, describing a
               Default or a Review Event and stating that the circumstance described is a Default or
               a Review Event it shall promptly notify the other Finance Parties.

       (f)     If the Agent is aware of the non-payment of any principal, interest, commitment fee
               or other fee payable to a Finance Party (other than the Agent or the Arranger) under
               this Agreement it shall promptly notify the other Finance Parties.

       (g)     The Agent shall have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly
               specified in the Finance Documents to which it is expressed to be a party (and no
               others shall be implied).

       (h)     If the Agent receives a request by a Lender, the Agent will provide a privacy notice
               (in the form recommended by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (Australian
               Branch) or as otherwise directed by a Finance Party) to a representative of the officers
               of an Obligor whose personal information has been collected on behalf of the Finance
               Parties, which details the manner in which personal information collected in
               connection with this Agreement may be used and disclosed by the Finance Parties.

27.4   Role of the Arranger
       Except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, the Arranger has no obligations of
       any kind to any other Party under or in connection with any Finance Document.

27.5   No fiduciary duties
       (a)     Nothing in any Finance Document constitutes the Agent or the Arranger as a trustee
               or fiduciary of any other person.

       (b)     Neither the Agent nor the Arranger shall be bound to account to any Lender for any
               sum or the profit element of any sum received by it for its own account.

27.6   Business with the Group
       The Agent and the Arranger may accept deposits from, lend money to, receive fees or other
       payments from and generally engage in any kind of banking, financial, trust, agency or other
       business with any Group Member.

27.7   Rights and discretions
       (a)     The Agent may:

               (i)   rely on any representation, communication, notice or document believed by it to
                     be genuine, correct and appropriately authorised;




32801928_16                                    - 103 -
              (ii)   assume that:

                     (A) any instructions received by it from the Majority Lenders, any Lenders or
                         any group of Lenders are duly given in accordance with the terms of the
                         Finance Documents; and

                     (B) unless it has received notice of revocation, that those instructions have not
                         been revoked; and

              (iii) rely on a written statement from any person:

                     (A) as to any matter of fact or circumstance which might reasonably be
                         expected to be within the knowledge of that person; or

                     (B) to the effect that such person approves of any particular dealing,
                         transaction, step, action or thing,

                     as sufficient evidence that that is the case and, in the case of paragraph (A)
                     above, may assume the truth and accuracy of that statement.

       (b)    The Agent may assume (unless it has received notice to the contrary in its capacity as
              agent for the Lenders) that:

              (i)    no Default or Review Event has occurred (unless it has actual knowledge of a
                     Default arising under Clause 23.1 (Non-payment));

              (ii)   any right, power, authority or discretion vested in any Party or any group of
                     Lenders has not been exercised; and

              (iii) any notice or request made by the Company (other than a Utilisation Request) is
                    made on behalf of and with the consent and knowledge of all the Obligors.

       (c)    The Agent may engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
              accountants, surveyors or other experts or professional advisers.

       (d)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (c) above or paragraph (e) below, the
              Agent may at any time engage and pay for the services of any lawyers to act as
              independent counsel to the Agent (and so separate from any lawyers instructed by the
              Lenders) if the Agent in its reasonable opinion deems this to be necessary.

       (e)    The Agent may rely on the advice or services of any lawyers, accountants, tax
              advisers, surveyors or other professional advisers or experts (whether obtained by the
              Agent or by any other Party) and shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses
              to any person, any diminution in value or any liability whatsoever arising as a result
              of its so relying.

       (f)    The Agent may act in relation to the Finance Documents through its officers,
              employees, secondees and agents.




32801928_16                                   - 104 -
       (g)      Unless a Finance Document expressly provides otherwise the Agent may disclose to
                any other Party any information it reasonably believes it has received as Agent under
                this Agreement.

       (h)      Without limiting paragraph (g) above, the Agent may disclose the identity of a
                Defaulting Finance Party to the other Finance Parties and the Company and shall
                disclose it on the written request of the Company or the Majority Lenders.

       (i)      Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the contrary,
                neither the Agent nor the Arranger is obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would
                or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a
                breach of a fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality.

       (j)      Notwithstanding any provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, the Agent is
                not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
                the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any
                right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of
                such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not
                reasonably assured to it.

       (k)      The Parties need not enquire whether any instructions from all or a percentage of
                Lenders or the Majority Lenders have been given to the Agent or as to the terms of
                those instructions. As between the other Parties on the one hand and the Agent and
                Lenders on the other, everything done by the Agent under or in relation to the Finance
                Documents will be taken to be authorised.

       (l)      The Agent will only be deemed to have knowledge, actual awareness or notice of a
                thing, or grounds or reason to believe a thing, if the officers or employees of the
                Agent having day to day responsibility for the administration of the Agent's
                Obligations under the Finance Documents have actual notice, actual awareness or
                actual notice of that thing or reason to believe that thing.

27.8   Responsibility for documentation
       Neither the Agent nor the Arranger is responsible or liable for:

       (a)      the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information (whether oral or written)
                supplied by the Agent, the Arranger, an Obligor or any other person given in or in
                connection with any Finance Document or the transactions contemplated in the
                Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document; or

       (b)      the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance
                Document or any other agreement, arrangement or document; or

       (c)      any determination as to whether any information provided or to be provided to any
                Finance Party is non-public information the use of which may be regulated or
                prohibited by applicable law or regulation relating to insider dealing or otherwise.




32801928_16                                     - 105 -
27.9   No duty to monitor
       The Agent shall not be bound to enquire:

       (a)     whether or not any Default or Review Event has occurred;

       (b)     as to credit or financial condition of any Party or the performance, default or any
               breach by any Party of its obligations under any Finance Document or any other
               agreement, arrangement or document;

       (c)     whether any other event specified in any Finance Document has occurred; or

       (d)     whether any Finance Document or any other document received by it is or contains a
               security interest under any PPS Law.

27.10 Exclusion of liability
      (a)     Without limiting paragraph (b) below (and without prejudice to any other provision of
              any Finance Document excluding or limiting the liability of the Agent), the Agent
              will not be liable for:

               (i)    any damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value, or any
                      liability whatsoever arising as a result of taking or not taking any action under
                      or in connection with any Finance Document, unless directly caused by its gross
                      negligence or Wilful Default;

               (ii)   exercising, or not exercising, any right, power, authority or discretion given to it
                      by, or in connection with, any Finance Document or any other agreement,
                      arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
                      under or in connection with, any Finance Document, other than by reason of its
                      gross negligence or Wilful Default; or

               (iii) without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, any
                     damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value or any liability
                     whatsoever (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category
                     of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the
                     Agent) arising as a result of:

                      (A) any act, event or circumstance not reasonably within its control; or

                      (B) the general risks of investment in, or the holding of assets in, any
                          jurisdiction,

                      including (in each case and without limitation) such damages, costs, losses to
                      any person, any diminution in value or any liability arising as a result of:
                      nationalisation, expropriation or other governmental actions; any regulation,
                      currency restriction, devaluation or fluctuation; market conditions affecting the
                      execution or settlement of transactions or the value of assets (including any
                      Disruption Event); breakdown, failure or malfunction of any third party
                      transport, telecommunications, computer services or systems; natural disasters

                       or acts of God; war, terrorism, insurrection or revolution; or strikes or industrial
                       action.

       (b)      No Party (other than the Agent) may take any proceedings against any officer,
                employee or agent of the Agent in respect of any claim it might have against the
                Agent or in respect of any act or omission of any kind by that officer, employee or
                agent in relation to any Finance Document and any officer, employee or agent of the
                Agent may rely on this Clause.

       (c)      The Agent will not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting
                an account with an amount required under the Finance Documents to be paid by the
                Agent if the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to
                comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or
                settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.

       (d)      Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the Agent or the Arranger to carry out:

                (i)    any "know your customer" or other checks in relation to any person; or

                (ii)   any check on the extent to which any transaction contemplated by this
                       Agreement might be unlawful for any Lender or for any Affiliate of any Lender,

                on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent and the Arranger that
                it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may
                not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or the
                Arranger.

       (e)      Without prejudice to any provision of any Finance Document excluding or limiting
                the Agent's liability, any liability of the Agent arising under or in connection with any
                Finance Document shall be limited to the amount of actual loss which has been
                suffered (as determined by reference to the date of default of the Agent or, if later, the
                date on which the loss arises as a result of such default) but without reference to any
                special conditions or circumstances known to the Agent at any time which increase
                the amount of that loss. In no event shall the Agent be liable for any loss of profits,
                goodwill, reputation, business opportunity or anticipated saving, or for special,
                punitive, indirect or consequential damages, whether or not the Agent has been
                advised of the possibility of such loss or damages.

27.11 Calculations
      Whenever the Agent is required to perform any calculation it may give to each party affected
      by that calculation a notice setting out the calculation. Each such party shall be taken to have
      accepted the calculation and the Agent shall have no liability to the relevant party in respect of
      that calculation to be incorrect by whichever is the later of:

       (a)      noon, Sydney time, on the Business Day following the date on which it receives the
                relevant calculation; and




32801928_16                                      - 107 -
       (b)      the time at which the Agent or any other person must act on the basis of the
                calculation or the calculation otherwise becomes binding under the Finance
                Documents.

       If the Agent is required to determine or obtain a quotation of a rate (including for the purposes
       of the Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange) the Agent is under no obligation to ensure that the rate it
       relies upon is the best rate available from the Reference Bank or otherwise.

27.12 PPS Law
      The Agent is not responsible for, and is not liable to any Party or other person for any loss, cost
      or expense in relation to:

       (a)      taking, or failing to take, any action for the purposes of any PPS Law, whether for the
                benefit of all Lenders or any particular Lender, unless it is expressly instructed to do
                so by the Majority Lenders;

       (b)      identifying, registering or perfecting under any PPS Law any security interest which
                may be constituted by or contained in any Finance Document or any other agreement,
                arrangement or document;

       (c)      the priority of any security interest in relation to this agreement or any other Finance
                Document or any transaction in connection with a Finance Document under any PPS
                Law;

       (d)      monitoring any PPS Law or the implementation of any PPS Law; or

       (e)      without limiting the foregoing, identifying or perfecting under the PPS Law any
                security interest which may be created by an assignment or transfer under a Finance
                Document.

27.13 Lenders' indemnity to the Agent
      (a)    Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total
             Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior
             to their reduction to zero) indemnify the Agent, within three Business Days of
             demand, against any cost, expense, loss or liability (including, without limitation, for
             negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Agent
             (otherwise than by reason of the Agent's gross negligence or Wilful Default) (or, in
             the case of any cost, expense, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 30.11 (Disruption to
             payment systems etc.) notwithstanding the Agent's negligence, gross negligence or
             any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the
             fraud of the Agent) in acting as Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the
             Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).

       (b)      A Lender's share will be the proportion of its share of the Total Commitments or, if
                the Total Commitments are then zero, its share of the Total Commitments
                immediately prior to their reduction to zero. Where a Lender's Commitment has been
                reduced to zero, but it has a participation in any outstanding Utilisations, then for this
                purpose its Commitment will be taken to be the aggregate amount of its participation
                (and the Total Commitments calculated accordingly).

       (c)     If any Lender fails to pay its share of any amount due under paragraph (a) one or
               more other Lenders may pay all or part of that share to the Agent. In that case, the
               defaulting Lender must immediately pay each such paying Lender the amount paid by
               that paying Lender together with interest equal to the rate from time to time certified
               by the paying Lender to be its cost of funds plus a margin of 2% per annum,
               compounding monthly.

       (d)     If any Lender fails to provide its share of security to the Agent when requested under
               Clause 27.7 (Rights and discretions) one or more other Lenders may provide all or
               part of that share on its behalf. Where that security is cash the non providing Lender
               must immediately pay each Lender that provided cash the amount provided by it
               together with interest equal to its cost of funds plus a margin of 2% per annum,
               compounding monthly.

27.14 Resignation of the Agent
      (a)     The Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates acting through an office in
              Australia as successor by giving notice to the Lenders and the Company.

       (b)     Alternatively the Agent may resign by giving 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the
               Company, in which case the Majority Lenders (after consultation with the Company)
               may appoint a successor Agent.

       (c)     If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with
               paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring
               Agent (after consultation with the Company) may appoint a successor Agent (acting
               through an office in the same time zone as Australia).

       (d)     If the Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no
               longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Agent is entitled to appoint a
               successor Agent under paragraph (c) above, the Agent may (if it concludes (acting
               reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor
               Agent to become a party to this Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed
               successor Agent amendments to this Clause 27 and any other term of this Agreement
               dealing with the rights or obligations of the Agent consistent with then current market
               practice for the appointment and protection of agents of syndicated financing
               transactions together with any reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable
               under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent's normal fee
               rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.

       (e)     The retiring Agent shall, make available to the successor Agent such documents and
               records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request
               for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.
               The Company shall, within three Business Days of demand, reimburse the retiring
               Agent for the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) properly
               incurred by it in making available such documents and records and providing such
               assistance save for where the Agent is a Defaulting Finance Party.




32801928_16                                    - 109 -
       (f)     The Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a
               successor.

       (g)     Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any
               further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents (other than its obligations
               under paragraph (e) above) but shall remain entitled to the benefit of Clause 15.3
               (Indemnity to the Agent) and this Clause 28 (and any agency fees for the account of
               the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date). Any
               successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations
               amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original
               Party.

       (h)     After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may, by notice to the
               Agent, require it to resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above. In this event, the
               Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above (or, at any time the Agent
               is a Defaulting Finance Party, by giving any shorter notice determined by the
               Majority Lenders).

       (i)     The Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above (and, to the extent
               applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Agent pursuant to
               paragraph (c) above) if on or after the date which is three months before the earliest
               FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Agent under the Finance
               Documents, either:

               (i)    the Agent fails to respond to a request under Clause 13.7 (FATCA Information)
                      and the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that the Agent will not be (or
                      will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA
                      Application Date;

               (ii)   the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to Clause 13.7 (FATCA
                      Information) indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a
                      FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or

               (iii) the Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the Agent will not be (or
                     will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA
                     Application Date;

               and (in each case) the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be
               required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Agent were a
               FATCA Exempt Party, and the Company or that Lender, by notice to the Agent,
               requires it to resign.

27.15 Confidentiality
      (a)    In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, the Agent shall be regarded as acting
             through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate entity from any other
             of its divisions or departments.




32801928_16                                    - 110 -
       (b)      If information is received by another division or department of the Agent, it may be
                treated as confidential to that division or department and the Agent shall not be
                deemed to have notice of it.

27.16 Relationship with the Lenders
      (a)     The Agent may treat the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of
              business (in the place of the Agent's principal office as notified to the Finance Parties
              from time to time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office:

                (i)    entitled to or liable for any payment due under any Finance Document on that
                       day; and

                (ii)   entitled to receive and act upon any notice, request, document or
                       communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance
                       Document made or delivered on that day,

                unless it has received not less than five Business Days' prior notice from that Lender
                to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

       (b)      Any Lender may by notice to the Agent appoint a person to receive on its behalf all
                notices, communications, information and documents to be made or despatched to
                that Lender under the Finance Documents. Such notice shall contain the address, fax
                number and electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable
                the sending and receipt of information by that means (and, in each case, the
                department or officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and
                be treated as a notification of a substitute address, fax number, electronic mail
                address, department and officer by that Lender for the purposes of Clause 32.2
                (Addresses) and the Agent shall be entitled to treat such person as the person entitled
                to receive all such notices, communications, information and documents as though
                that person were that Lender.

       (c)      The Agent may rely on or receive instructions from any attorney acting on behalf of a
                Lender, or any person acting on behalf of a Lender whose title or acting title includes
                the word Manager, Head, Executive, Director or President or cognate expressions, or
                any secretary or director of a Lender.

27.17 Credit appraisal by the Lenders
      Without affecting the responsibility of any Obligor for information supplied by it or on its
      behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to the Agent and the
      Arranger that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own
      independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any
      Finance Document including but not limited to:

       (a)      the financial condition, status and nature of each Group Member;

       (b)      the legality, validity, priority, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any
                Finance Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document;




32801928_16                                    - 111 -
       (c)     whether that Lender has recourse, and the nature and extent of that recourse, against
               any Party or any of its respective assets under or in connection with any Finance
               Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other
               agreement, arrangement or document; and

       (d)     the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any other information provided by the
               Agent, any Party or by any other person under or in connection with any Finance
               Document, the transactions contemplated by any Finance Documents or any other
               agreement, arrangement or document.

27.18 Role of Reference Banks
      (a)     No Reference Bank is under any obligation to provide a quotation or any other
              information to the Agent.

       (b)     No Reference Bank will be liable for any action taken by it under or in connection
               with any Finance Document, or for any Reference Bank Quotation, unless directly
               caused by its gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

       (c)     No Party (other than the relevant Reference Bank) may take any proceedings against
               any officer, employee or agent of any Reference Bank in respect of any claim it may
               have against that Reference Bank or in respect of any act or omission of any kind by
               that officer, employee or agent in relation to any Finance Document, or to any
               Reference Bank Quotation.

       (d)     Any officer, employee or agent of each Reference Bank may rely on this Clause. The
               Reference Bank holds the benefit of this Clause on trust for any such officer,
               employee or agent.

27.19 Third party Reference Banks
      This Agreement constitutes an irrevocable offer by each Party to each Reference Bank, which
      accepts the offer by consenting to be a Reference Bank and providing a Reference Bank
      Quotation. It may rely on Clause 27.18 (Role of Reference Banks) and Clause 40
      (Confidentiality of Funding Rates and Reference Bank Quotations).

27.20 Agent's management time
      Any amount payable to the Agent under Clause 15.3 (Indemnity to the Agent), Clause 17
      (Costs and expenses) and Clause 27.11 (Lenders' indemnity to the Agent) shall include the cost
      of utilising the Agent's management time or other resources and will be calculated on the basis
      of such reasonable daily or hourly rates as the Agent may notify to the Company and the
      Lenders, and is in addition to any fee paid or payable to the Agent under Clause 12 (Fees).

27.21 Deduction from amounts payable by the Agent
      If any Party owes an amount to the Agent under the Finance Documents the Agent may, after
      giving notice to that Party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from any payment to
      that Party which the Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents
      and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the
      purposes of the Finance Documents that Party shall be regarded as having received any amount
      so deducted.

28.    CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY THE FINANCE PARTIES
       No provision of this Agreement will:

       (a)     interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its affairs (tax or otherwise) in
               whatever manner it thinks fit;

       (b)     oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit, relief, remission or
               repayment available to it or the extent, order and manner of any claim; or

       (c)     oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its affairs (tax or
               otherwise) or any computations in respect of Tax.

29.    SHARING AMONG THE FINANCE PARTIES
29.1   Payments to Finance Parties
       (a)   If a Finance Party (a "Recovering Finance Party") receives or recovers (including by
             combination of accounts or set off) any amount from an Obligor other than in
             accordance with Clause 30 (Payment Mechanics) and applies that amount to a
             payment due under the Finance Documents (other than a Hedging Agreement) then:

               (i)    the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of
                      the receipt or recovery to the Agent;

               (ii)   the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the
                      amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or
                      recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with
                      Clause 30 (Payment Mechanics), without taking account of any Tax which
                      would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or
                      distribution; and

               (iii) the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by
                     the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such
                     receipt or recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be
                     retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be
                     made, in accordance with Clause 30.6 (Partial payments).

29.2   Redistribution of payments
       The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the relevant Obligor and
       distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance Party) (the
       "Sharing Finance Parties") in accordance with Clause 30.6 (Partial payments) towards the
       obligations of that Obligor to the Sharing Finance Parties.

29.3   Recovering Finance Party's rights
       (a)    Unless paragraph (b) applies:

               (i)    the receipt or recovery referred to in Clause 29.1 (Payments to Finance Parties)
                      will be taken to have been a payment for the account of the Agent and not to the
                      Recovering Finance Party for its own account, and the liability of the relevant
                      Obligor to the Recovering Finance Party will only be reduced to the extent of




32801928_16                                    - 113 -
                      any distribution retained by the Recovering Finance Party under Clause
                      29.1(a)(iii) (Payments to Finance Parties); and

               (ii)   (without limiting sub-paragraph (i)) the relevant Obligor shall indemnify the
                      Recovering Finance Party against a payment under Clause 29.1(a)(iii)
                      (Payments to Finance Parties) to the extent that (despite sub-paragraph (i)) its
                      liability has been discharged by the recovery or payment.

       (b)     Where:

               (i)    the amount referred to in Clause 29.1 (Payments to Finance Parties) above was
                      received or recovered otherwise than by payment (for example, set off); and

               (ii)   the relevant Obligor, or the person from whom the receipt or recovery is made,
                      is insolvent at the time of the receipt or recovery, or at the time of the payment
                      to the Agent, or becomes insolvent as a result of the receipt or recovery,

               then the following will apply so that the Finance Parties have the same rights and
               obligations as if the money had been paid by the relevant Obligor to the Agent for the
               account of the Finance Parties and distributed accordingly:

               (iii) each other Finance Party will assign to the Recovering Finance Party an amount
                     of the debt owed by the relevant Obligor to that Finance Party under the Finance
                     Documents equal to the amount received by that Finance Party under Clause
                     29.2 (Redistribution of payments);

               (iv) the Recovering Finance Party will be entitled to all rights (including interest and
                    voting rights) under the Finance Documents in respect of the debt so assigned;
                    and

               (v)    that assignment will take effect automatically on payment of the Sharing
                      Payment by the Agent to the other Finance Party.

29.4   Reversal of redistribution
       If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party
       becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

       (a)     each Sharing Finance Party shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for the
               account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of
               its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to
               reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the
               Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to pay) (the
               "Redistributed Amount");

       (b)     as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount
               equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by
               that Obligor and the relevant Obligor shall indemnify the Sharing Finance Party
               against a payment under sub-paragraph (a) to the extent that the relevant Obligor's
               liability has been discharged by the recovery or payment; and




32801928_16                                     - 114 -
       (c)     to the extent necessary, any debt assigned under paragraph (b) of Clause 29.3
               (Recovering Finance Party's rights) will be reassigned.

29.5   Exceptions
       (a)     This Clause 29 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party would
               not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause, have a valid and enforceable
               claim (or right of proof in an administration) against the relevant Obligor.

       (b)     A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any
               amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of
               taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

               (i)    it notified that other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

               (ii)   that other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or

                      having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration

                                          ADMINISTRATION

30.    PAYMENT MECHANICS
30.1   Payments to the Agent
       (a)   On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a
             Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of a Hedging Agreement,
             that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary
             indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date no later than
             11.00am (Sydney time) in immediately available funds or if agreed by the Agent in
             such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of
             transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

       (b)      Payment shall be made to such account:

                (i)    in the case of Australian dollars, at the city of the Agent; or

                (ii)   in the case of any other currency, in the principal financial centre of the country
                       of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in a
                       Participating Member State or London as specified by the Agent),

                with such bank as the Agent, in each case, specifies.

       (c)      Payment by an Obligor to the Agent for the account of a Finance Party satisfies the
                Obligor's obligations to make that payment.

30.2   Distributions by the Agent
       Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall,
       subject to Clause 30.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and Clause 30.4 (Clawback and pre-
       funding) be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party
       entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the
       account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less
       than five Business Days' notice with a bank specified by that Party in Australia, in the case of
       Australian dollars, and, in the case of any other currency in the principal financial centre of the
       country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a
       Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).

30.3   Distributions to an Obligor
       The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 31 (Set-off))
       apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the
       currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance
       Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

30.4   Clawback and pre-funding
       (a)    Where a sum is to be paid by a Party (the Payer) to the Agent under the Finance
              Documents for another Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other
              Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able
              to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.




32801928_16                                       - 116 -
       (b)     Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Agent pays an amount to another Party and
               it proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the
               Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was
               paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest
               on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent,
               calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

       (c)     If the Agent is willing to make available amounts for the account of a Borrower
               before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the extent that the Agent does
               so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in
               respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:

               (i)    the Agent shall notify the Company of that Lender's identity and the Borrower
                      to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the Agent;
                      and

               (ii)   the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that
                      Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available, shall
                      on demand pay to the Agent the amount (as certified by the Agent) which will
                      indemnify the Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying
                      out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.

       (d)     The Payer will still remain liable to make the assumed payment, but until the other
               Party does repay the Agent under paragraph (b), the Payer's liability will be to the
               Agent in the Agent's own right.

30.5   Agent a Defaulting Finance Party
       (a)     If, at any time, the Agent becomes Defaulting Finance Party, a Party which is required
               to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent for the account of
               other Parties under Clause 30.1 (Payments to the Agent) may instead on the due date
               for payment either pay that amount direct to the required payee or pay that amount to
               an interest-bearing account held in the name of the payer and designated as a trust
               account for the benefit of the payee or payees with a bank rated at least A- by
               Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd or A3 by Moody’s Investors
               Services Limited or a comparable rating from an internationally recognised credit
               rating agency.

       (b)     All interest accrued on the trust account will be for the benefit of the beneficiaries of
               that trust account pro rata to their respective entitlements.

       (c)     A Party which has made a payment under paragraph (a) shall be discharged of the
               relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take any
               credit risk with respect to the amounts in the trust account.

       (d)     Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent under Clause 27.14
               (Resignation of the Agent), each Party which has made a payment to a trust account
               under paragraph (a) shall give all requisite instructions to the bank to transfer the




32801928_16                                    - 117 -
               amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution
               under Clause 30.2 (Distributions by the Agent).

30.6   Partial payments
       (a)      If the Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then
                due and payable by an Obligor under the Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply
                that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents in
                the following order:

               (i)    first, in or towards payment pro rata of any amounts payable but unpaid in
                      respect of fees, costs, expenses, losses or liabilities of the Agent or the Arranger
                      under the Finance Documents or the Security Trustee under the Finance
                      Documents;

               (ii)   secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of all amounts (including interest)
                      payable by the Obligor to Lenders in respect of amounts or security paid or
                      provided by the Lenders to the Agent in place of another Lender under Clause
                      27.13(c) or 27.13(d) (Lenders' indemnity to the Agent);

               (iii) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of all amounts payable by the Obligor to
                     Lenders in respect of amounts or security paid by the Lenders to the Agent
                     under Clause 27.13(a) (Lenders' indemnity to the Agent) or Clause 27.2
                     (Instructions) plus interest on such amounts;

               (iv) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fees or
                    commission due but unpaid under the Finance Documents;

               (v)    fifthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under
                      those Finance Documents; and

               (vi) sixthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under
                    the Finance Documents.

       (b)     The Agent shall, if so directed by all Lenders, vary the order set out in paragraphs
               (a)(ii) to (a)(vi) above inclusive.

       (c)     Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by an Obligor.

30.7   No set-off by Obligors
       All payments to be made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall be calculated and
       be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.

30.8   Business Days
       (a)     Any payment under the Finance Documents which is due to be made on a day that is
               not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar
               month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

       (b)     During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal under this
               Agreement interest is payable on the principal at the rate payable on the original due
               date.

30.9   Currency of account
       (a)    Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, the Base Currency is the currency of account
              and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under any Finance Document.

       (b)     A repayment or a prepayment of a Loan or a part of a Loan shall be made in the
               currency in which that Loan is denominated, pursuant to this Agreement, on its due
               date.

       (c)     Each payment of interest shall be made in the currency in which the sum in respect of
               which the interest is payable was denominated, pursuant to this Agreement, when that
               interest accrued.

       (d)     Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in
               which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

       (e)     Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency shall
               be paid in that other currency.

30.10 Change of currency
      (a)    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or currency unit are at
             the same time recognised by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of
             that country, then:

               (i)    any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under
                      the Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into,
                      or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by the Agent
                      (after consultation with the Company); and

               (ii)   any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the
                      official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of
                      that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Agent
                      (acting reasonably).

       (b)     If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will, to the extent the
               Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Company) specifies to be
               necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and
               market practice in the Relevant Market and otherwise to reflect the change in
               currency.

30.11 Disruption to payment systems etc.
      If either the Agent determines (in its discretion) that a Disruption Event has occurred or the
      Agent is notified by the Company that a Disruption Event has occurred:

       (a)     the Agent may, and shall if requested to do so by the Company, consult with the
               Company with a view to agreeing with the Company such changes to the operation or
               administration of the Facilities as the Agent may deem necessary in the
               circumstances;




32801928_16                                    - 119 -
       (b)     the Agent shall not be obliged to consult with the Company in relation to any changes
               mentioned in paragraph (a) above if, in its opinion, it is not practicable to do so in the
               circumstances and, in any event, shall have no obligation to agree to such changes;

       (c)     the Agent may consult with the Finance Parties in relation to any changes mentioned
               in paragraph (a) above but shall not be obliged to do so if, in its opinion, it is not
               practicable to do so in the circumstances;

       (d)     any such changes agreed upon by the Agent and the Company shall (whether or not it
               is finally determined that a Disruption Event has occurred) be binding upon the
               Parties as an amendment to (or, as the case may be, waiver of) the terms of the
               Finance Documents notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 36 (Amendments and
               Waivers);

       (e)     the Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses to any person, any
               diminution in value or any liability whatsoever (including, without limitation for
               negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not
               including any claim based on the fraud of the Agent) arising as a result of its taking,
               or failing to take, any actions pursuant to or in connection with this Clause 30.11; and

       (f)     the Agent shall notify the Finance Parties of all changes agreed pursuant to paragraph
               (d) above.

30.12 Anti-money laundering
      (a)    A Finance Party may delay, block or refuse to process any payment or other
             transaction without incurring any liability if the Finance Party knows or reasonably
             suspects that the transaction or the application of its proceeds will:

               (i)    breach, or cause a Finance Party to breach, any applicable laws or regulations of
                      any jurisdiction (including any sanctions); or

               (ii)   allow the imposition of any penalty on the Finance Party or its Affiliates under
                      any such law or regulation,

               including where the transaction or the application of its proceeds involves any entity
               or activity the subject of any applicable sanctions of any jurisdiction binding on the
               Finance Party or its Affiliate, or the direct or indirect proceeds of unlawful activity.

       (b)     As soon as practicable after a Finance Party becomes aware that it will delay, block or
               refuse to process a transaction under paragraph (a), it will notify the Company and the
               Agent and consult in good faith but in each case only to the extent the Finance Party
               determines it is legally permitted to do so. In making that determination the Finance
               Party shall act reasonably.

       (c)     The Company shall promptly advise the Agent if any Obligor enters into any Finance
               Document in the capacity as agent and promptly supply, or procure the supply of,
               such information as may be reasonably requested by the Agent (for itself or on behalf
               of any Finance Party) from time to time in relation to any principal for which an
               Obligor may be acting.



32801928_16                                    - 120 -
       (d)      Each Obligor undertakes to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the
                Finance Documents in accordance with all applicable laws or regulations relating to
                anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing or sanctions.

30.13 "Know your customer"
      Each Lender shall promptly upon the request of the Agent supply, or procure the supply of,
      such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent (for itself) in
      order for the Agent to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your
      customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations pursuant to the
      transactions contemplated in the Finance Documents.

31.    SET-OFF
       If a Default is continuing a Finance Party may, but need not, set off any matured obligation due
       from an Obligor under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that
       Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party to that Obligor,
       regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation. If the
       obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a
       market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

                that department or officer.

       (b)      All communication to or from an Obligor must be sent through the Agent (except for

                sent through the Security Trustee).

       (c)      Any communication or document made or delivered to the Company in accordance

       Promptly upon receipt of notification of an address, fax number and email address or change of
       address, fax number or email address of an Obligor under Clause 32.2 (Addresses) or upon
       changing its own address, fax number or email address, the Agent shall notify the other Parties.

32.5   Communication when Agent is a Defaulting Finance Party
       If and so long as the Agent is a Defaulting Finance Party, the Parties may, instead of
       communicating with each other through the Agent, communicate with each other directly and
       all the provisions of the Finance Documents which require communications to be made or

       (b)    In relation to an email with attached files:

              (i)    if the attached files are more than 5 MB in total, then:

                     (A) at the time of dispatch the giver of the e-mail must send a separate email
                         without attachments notifying the recipient of the dispatch of the email;
                         and

32.7   Communication through secure website
       (a)  The Agent may establish a secure website to which access is restricted to the Agent
            and the Lenders or the Obligors or both (and, where applicable, their respective
            financial and legal advisers).

       (b)     After the Agent notifies the Lenders or the Company on behalf of the Obligors or both
               (as the case may be) of the establishment of the secure website, then any
               communication or document given or delivered by or to the Agent to or by Lenders or
               Obligors (as the case may be):

               (i)    may be given by means of the secure website in the manner specified by the
                      Agent (or in the absence of such specification, as specified by the operator of
                      the website); and

               (ii)   unless otherwise agreed will be taken to be made or delivered upon satisfaction
                      of the following:

                      (A) a communication or document being posted on that secure website;

                      (B) either:

                           (A)   receipt by the Agent of an email from the relevant website
                                 confirming that the website has sent an email to the relevant Party's
                                 email addresses nominated under paragraph (d) notifying that a
                                 communication or document has been uploaded on the website; or

                           (B)   the website containing or providing confirmation that the
                                 communication or document has been opened by the intended
                                 recipient; and

                      (C) compliance with any other requirements specified by the Agent under
                          paragraph (c).

       (c)     By notice to the Lenders or the Company on behalf of the Obligors or both (as the
               case may be) the Agent acting reasonably may from time to time specify and amend
               rules concerning the operation of the secure website in the manner in which
               communications or documents may be posted, and will be taken to have been made or
               delivered. Those rules or moments will bind the recipients of the notice and the
               Agent.

       (d)     When it establishes the secure website, the Agent shall nominate to the website for
               each Party the email address given to it by the Party under this Clause 32.
               Subsequently, the nominated email address for each Party for that website will be the
               address nominated by that Party to the secure website or by the Agent (who will
               notify the Party accordingly). It is the responsibility of each Party to ensure that the
               email address nominated for it is up-to-date. The Agent is under no obligation to
               notify the secure website of any change in email address notified to it.

       (e)     The Company consents to the inclusion in the secure website of its company logo.

       (f)      Each of the other Parties agrees that the Agent is not liable for any liability, loss,
                damage, costs or expenses incurred or suffered by them as a result of their access or
                use of the secure website or inability to access or use the secure website except to the
                extent caused by its gross negligence or Wilful Default.

32.8   Reliance
       (a)     Any communication or document sent under this Clause 32 can be relied on by the
               recipient if the recipient reasonably believes it to be genuine and (if such a signature
               is required under Clause 32.1(b)) it bears what appears to be the signature (original or
               facsimile or email) of an authorised signatory of the sender (without the need for
               further enquiry or confirmation).

       (b)      Each Party must take reasonable care to ensure that no forged, false or unauthorised
                notices are sent to another Party.

32.9   English language
       (a)     Any notice or other communication given under or in connection with any Finance
               Document must be in English.

       (b)      All other documents provided under or in connection with any Finance Document
                must be:

                (i)    in English; or

                (ii)   if not in English, and if so required by the Agent, accompanied by a certified
                       English translation and, in this case, the English translation will prevail unless
                       the document is a constitutional, statutory or other official document.

33.    CALCULATIONS AND CERTIFICATES
33.1   Accounts
       In any litigation or arbitration proceedings arising out of or in connection with a Finance
       Document, the entries made in the accounts maintained by a Finance Party are prima facie
       evidence of the matters to which they relate.

33.2   Certificates and Determinations
       Any certification or determination by a Finance Party of a rate or amount under any Finance
       Document is, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive evidence of the matters to which it
       relates.

33.3   Day count convention
       Any interest, commission or fee accruing under a Finance Document will accrue from day to
       day and is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 365 days
       or, in any case where the practice in the Relevant Market differs, in accordance with that
       market practice.

       (a)      any Finance Party has at any time released or discharged:

                (i)    an Obligor from its obligations under any Finance Document; or

                (ii)   any assets of an Obligor from a Transaction Security,

                in either case in reliance on a payment, receipt or other transaction to or in favour of
                any Finance Party; or

       (b)      any payment, receipt or other transaction to or in favour of any Finance Party has the
                effect of releasing or discharging:

                (i)    an Obligor from its obligations under any Finance Document; or

                (ii)   any assets of an Obligor from a Transaction Security; and

       (c)      that payment, receipt or other transaction is subsequently claimed by any person to be
                void, voidable or capable of being set aside for any reason (including under any law
                relating to insolvency, sequestration, liquidation, winding up or bankruptcy and any
                provision of any agreement, arrangement or scheme, formal or informal, relating to
                the administration of any of the assets of any person); and

       (d)      that claim is upheld or is conceded or compromised by a Finance Party,

       then:

                (i)    each Finance Party will immediately become entitled against that Obligor to all
                       rights (including under any Finance Document) as it had immediately before
                       that release or discharge;

                (ii)   that Obligor must, to the extent permitted by law:

                       (A) immediately do all things and execute all documents as any Finance Party
                           may, acting reasonably, require to restore to each Finance Party all those
                           rights; and

                       (B) indemnify each Finance Party against all costs and losses suffered or
                           incurred by it in or in connection with any negotiations or proceedings
                           relating to the claim or as a result of the upholding, concession or
                           compromise of the claim.

34.    PARTIAL INVALIDITY
       If, at any time, any provision of a Finance Document is or becomes illegal, invalid or
       unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or
       enforceability of the remaining provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such
       provision under the law of any other jurisdiction will in any way be affected or impaired.

35.    REMEDIES AND WAIVERS
       No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Finance Party, any right
       or remedy under a Finance Document shall operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy or



32801928_16                                     - 127 -
       constitute an election to affirm any of the Finance Documents. No election to affirm any
       Finance Document on the part of any Finance Party shall be effective unless it is in writing.
       No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy shall prevent any further or other exercise
       or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in each Finance
       Document are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

               applicable) without the consent of any other Party (including any Lender or class of
               Lenders) if that amendment or waiver is to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect

37.    INSTRUCTIONS AND DECISIONS
37.1   Abstentions
       In determining whether the Majority Lenders, have given instructions or a consent, approval,
       waiver, amendment or other decision, a Lender will be deemed to have Commitments or a
       participation of zero if it has so elected by notice to the Agent.

37.2   Transferees bound
       A consent, approval, waiver, amendment or other decision by a Lender or any instruction to
       the Agent by a Lender binds that Lender's assigns and successors unless revoked under Clause
       37.3 (Limitations on revocation).

37.3   Limitations on revocation
       Any instructions, consent, approval, waiver, amendment or other decision by the Majority
       Lenders may be revoked only by the Majority Lenders, and may not be revoked if the decision
       has been acted upon.

37.4   Failure to respond
       If any Lender fails to respond to a request for instructions, consent, approval, waiver,
       amendment or other decision in relation to any Finance Document within 10 Business Days of
       the response date advised by the Agent (or if no period is specified, within 15 Business Days
       after the date that the Lender has been provided with all information necessary to make the
       relevant decision) for that request (or any longer period agreed by the Company and the
       Agent), that Lender, its Commitment and its participation shall not be included for the purpose
       of calculating the Total Commitments or participations under the relevant Facility/ies when
       ascertaining whether all Lenders with any relevant percentage of Total Commitments and/or
       participations have responded to that request.

37.5   Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Finance Parties
       For so long as a Defaulting Finance Party has any Available Commitment, in ascertaining the
       Majority Lenders or whether any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
       unanimity) of the Total Commitments or the Commitments of any specified group of Lenders
       or the agreement of all Lenders or all of any specified group of Lenders has been obtained in
       respect of any request for instructions, consent, approval, waiver, amendment or other decision
       under the Finance Documents, that Defaulting Finance Party's Commitments will be reduced
       by the amount of its Available Commitments.

       For the purposes of this Clause 37.5, the Agent may assume that the following Lenders are
       Defaulting Finance Parties:

       (a)     any Lender which has notified the Agent that it has become a Defaulting Finance
               Party;

       (b)     any Lender in relation to which the relevant officers of the Agent having day to day
               conduct of its role are aware that any of the events or circumstances referred to in the
               definition of "Defaulting Finance Party" has occurred,

       unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any
       supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Agent) or the Agent is otherwise aware that
       the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Finance Party.

37.6   Replacement of a Defaulting Finance Party
       (a)    The Company may, at any time a Lender has become and continues to be a Defaulting
              Finance Party, by giving 10 Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent and such

               (ii)   transfer all of the undrawn Commitments of the Lender,

               to a Lender or another bank, financial institution, or to a trust, fund or other entity

               investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (including credit derivatives) (a
               "Replacement Lender") selected by the Company, and which (unless the Agent is an
               Defaulting Finance Party) is acceptable to the Agent (acting reasonably), which
               confirms its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations or all the
               relevant obligations of the transferring Lender (including the assumption of the
               transferring Lender's participations or unfunded participations (as the case may be) on
               the same basis as the transferring Lender) for a purchase price in cash payable at the

               Clause 37 shall be subject to the following conditions:

                     paragraph (a) above; and

39.    PPS LAW PROVISIONS
39.1   Exclusion of certain provisions of the PPS Law
       Where any Finance Party has a security interest (as defined in the PPS Law under any Finance
       Document, to the extent the law permits:

       (a)     in relation to the Australian PPSA, each Obligor agrees that:

               (i)    for the purposes of sections 115(1) and 115(7) of the Australian PPSA:

                      (A) each Finance Party with the benefit of the security interest need not
                          comply with sections 95, 118, 121(4), 125,130, 132(3)(d) or 132(4) of the
                          Australian PPSA; and

                      (B) sections 142 and 143 of the Australian PPSA are excluded;

               (ii)   for the purposes of section 115(7) of the Australian PPSA, each Finance Party
                      with the benefit of the security interest need not comply with sections 132 and
                      137(3);

               (iii) each Party waives its right to receive from any Finance Party any notice
                     required under the Australian PPSA (including a notice of a verification
                     statement);

       (b)     in relation to the NZ PPS Law, each Obligor agrees that:

               (i)    it contracts out of sections 114(1)(a), 133 and 134 of the NZ PPSA; and

               (ii)   it waives its rights to;

                      (A) receive a statement of account under section 116 of the NZ PPSA;

                      (B) receive notice of the Secured Party’s proposal to retain Personal Property
                          under section 120(2) of the NZ PPSA;

                      (C) object to the Secured Party’s proposal to retain any Personal Property
                          under section 121 of the NZ PPSA;

                      (D) not have goods damaged when the Secured Party (or any person on its
                          behalf) removes an accession under section 125 of the NZ PPSA;




32801928_16                                      - 136 -
                     (E)   be reimbursed for damage caused when the Secured Party (or any person
                           on its behalf) removes an accession under section 126 of the NZ PPSA;

                     (F)   refuse permission to remove an accession under section 127 of the NZ
                           PPSA;

                     (G) receive notice of the removal of an accession under section 129 of the NZ
                         PPSA; and

                     (H) apply to the court for an order concerning the removal of an accession
                         under section 131 of the NZ PPSA.

       (c)     This does not affect any rights a person has or would have other than by reason of the
               PPS Law and applies despite any other Clause in any Finance Document.

       (d)     If a Finance Party with the benefit of a security interest exercises a right, power or
               remedy in connection with it, that exercise is taken not to be an exercise of a right,
               power or remedy under the PPS Law unless the Finance Party states otherwise at the
               time of exercise. However, this Clause does not apply to a right, power or remedy
               which can only be exercised under the PPS Law.

       (e)     Where a Finance Party has Powers in addition to, or existing separately from, those in
               Chapter 4 of the Australian PPSA or Part 9 of the NZ PPSA, those Powers will
               continue to apply and are not limited or excluded (or otherwise adversely affected) by
               the Australian PPSA or the NZ PPSA (as the case may be). This is despite any other
               provision of a Finance Document.

       (f)     If the PPS Law is amended to permit the Parties to agree not to comply with or to
               exclude other provisions of the PPS Law, the Agent may notify the Company and the
               Finance Parties that any of these provisions is excluded, or that the Finance Parties
               need not comply with any of these provisions.

39.2   Further assurances
       Whenever the Agent reasonably requests an Obligor to do anything:

       (a)     to ensure any Finance Document (or any security interest (as defined in the PPSA) or
               other Security under any Finance Document) is fully effective, enforceable and
               perfected with the contemplated priority;

       (b)     for more satisfactorily assuring or securing to the Finance Parties the property the
               subject of any such security interest or other Security in a manner consistent with the
               Finance Documents; or

       (c)     for aiding the exercise of any power in any Finance Document,

       the Obligor shall do it promptly at its own cost. This may include obtaining consents, signing
       documents, getting documents completed and signed and supplying information, delivering
       documents and evidence of title and executed blank transfers, or otherwise giving possession
       or control with respect to any property the subject of any security interest or Security.

                      circumstances;

       Obligor) in each Finance Document are continuing and survive termination of the Finance

             owned subsidiary of the Company’s holding company the prior agreement to the Company's
             entry into and performance of the Document[s] and the Transactions has been obtained from

7.1     [Option 1: <The Transactions do not include or involve any provision by the Company

         or indirectly) of financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of a share issued or to
         be issued by the Company or its holding company. Accordingly, all of the entitled persons in
         relation to the Company have agreed in writing (pursuant to section 107(1)(e) of the Act) to
         the Company’s entry into and performance of the Documents and the Transactions (so that
         nothing in sections 76 to 80 of the Act will apply to the Transactions).

         Prior to the provision of the financial assistance, the Board, after taking into account all
         relevant factors, resolved that it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Company would,
         immediately after the giving of the financial assistance, satisfy the solvency test as set out in
         section 4, as modified by section 108(5), of the Act.

         the financial assistance is given, satisfy the solvency test as set out in section 4, as modified
         by section 108(5), of the Act.

         As far as I am aware, at no time since the passing of the resolution referred to in paragraph
         6.2 has the Board, or any director of the Company, ceased to be satisfied that the Company
         will satisfy the solvency test immediately after the giving of the financial assistance.>]

                       Trustee other than Trust assets.

(c)   Paragraphs (a) and (b) apply despite any other provision in this Transfer Certificate or
      the Agreement but do not apply with respect to any liability of Trustee to another
      party (including for negligence) to the extent that Trustee has no right or power to
      have Trust assets applied towards satisfaction of that liability, or its right or power to
      do so is subject to a deduction, reduction, limit or requirement to make good, in any
      case because Trustee has acted beyond power or improperly in relation to the Trust.

(c)   Paragraphs (a) and (b) apply despite any other provision in this Transfer Certificate or
      the Agreement but do not apply with respect to any liability of Trustee to another
      party (including for negligence) to the extent that Trustee has no right or power to
      have Trust assets applied towards satisfaction of that liability, or its right or power to
      do so is subject to a deduction, reduction, limit or requirement to make good, in any
      case because Trustee has acted beyond power or improperly in relation to the Trust.

(d)   The limitation in paragraph (b)(i) is to be disregarded for the purposes (but only for
      the purposes) of the rights and remedies described in paragraph (b)(ii), and
      interpreting this Transfer Certificate and the Agreement and any security for it,
